# wizAPI

An API to interact and make bots in Wizard101

The wizAPI.py file contains a large number of functions to interact with Wizard101, Hopefully, you will find it useful :)

# IMPORTANT

Make sure your windows are set to an 800 x 600 resolution and your interface size is Medium

To add your own spells, use the 'screenshot' function from the API when spell selection is opened.
Take this image and crop it so that only the image of the spell is visible (see spells folder for examples)
Rename it to the name of the spell, and add it to the spells folder.

I will probably add docs when I get the time.
